# Kaggle_RPS
Kaggle's Rock Papper Scissors Competition

The goal of the competition is to create an agent that will compete against other agents playing Rock Paper Scissors.

Each round we will have a few hundred milliseconds to predict our opponents next move. 
Due to time constraints we will be exploring classical ML models.
Ideally we will have a model that is predictive of our opponent and opaque to predictions from our opponent.
